HelloWorld Scala Servlet

This is a very simple servlet meant to demonstrate embedding jetty in scala
using sbt 0.11 in order to create a runnable servlet.  The documentation around
using the latest version of Jetty with sbt 0.11 was rather skimpy so this took
much longer than it should have.

It wasn't clear whether the xsbt-web-plugin
(https://github.com/siasia/xsbt-web-plugin/) worked with Jetty 8, but
apparantly it does.  The xsbt-web-plugin is added in project/plugins.sbt.
It is also necessary to have Jetty on the classpath for the "container"
scope, as specified in the build.xml.

To run this program, in sbt run:

  container:start

Then you can see "Hello world!" at http://localhost:8080/.

Here are a few other commands:

  container:reload
  container:stop

Sometimes it's nice to have your project continuously deployed (deployed after
each saved change):

  container:start
  ~aux-compile
